## Overview

Rusic allows you to scan your local directories for audio files, or you jellyfin library, automatically organizing them into a browsable library. You can navigate by artists, albums, or explore your custom playlists. The application is built for performance and desktop integration, utilizing the power of Rust.

## Features

- **Theming**: Includes dynamic theming support to customize the visual appearance.
- **Native Integration**: Integrates with system media controls (MPRIS) and "Now Playing" displays.
- **Discord RPC**: Embedded RPC included!!!
- **Double Option**: Yes, you can also use your jellyfin server to listen to your music coming from your server!

## Installation

### Flatpak (Recommended)

Rusic is soon available on Flathub. To install from source manifest:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temidaradev/rusic
cd rusic
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir com.temidaradev.rusic.json
flatpak run com.temidaradev.rusic
```

You can also click on the file and open it with an app provider, for example KDE discover

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temidaradev/rusic
cd rusic
npm install
dx serve --package rusic
```

### MacOS Quarantine

Because Apple hates open-source software, they have made it harder for users to install them since they don't explicitly "trust" them. Though the source code can be verified by yours truly. However, in the meantime, after downloading the ``.dmg`` and dragging the app to your /Applications, use:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Rusic.app
```

### Scrobbling functionality

Scrobbling functionality is only available through MusicBrainz (for now). To enable it, you need to provide a valid MusicBrainz token in the configuration file. The scrobbling also is only available for your local musics. It's highly recommended to use [jellyfin-plugin-listenbrainz](https://github.com/lyarenei/jellyfin-plugin-listenbrainz), because if you also use other music apps for your jellyfin server, you can scrobble your music from anywhere.
